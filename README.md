- Built with Jekyll 
- Generate the site locally with `jekyll serve`
- Shopping cart via a magical line of js (and product attributes defined in button) from Snipcart
- Payment processing via Stripe
- Site is hosted on Mark's personal Media Temple (MT) account
- Ruby RAKEFILE in the project is setup to deply the site to MT by running `rake deploy` (you'll need to enter the MT ssh password when prompted)
- DNS managed by Cloudflare
- DNS registered with 101Domains (which I'm currently locked out of for some reason)
- CSS is Sass which is magically preprocessed by Jekyll
